# chairgrind
A series of python tools developed to streamline a department chair's job. Please send me any bug/feedback/constructive comment/suggestion/better codes at ydubief@uvm.edu

## Codes
Codes are written in python and typically read excel spreadsheet either physically on your computer or on the web. I use python notebook to prototype and comment, but feel free to copy and paste into a .py file if you are more comfortable with such approach. I try to write codes where all them modifications for your need are at the top and the rest is pretty much a blackbox. If you don't need profound modifications, you may not even need to learn python. But you should because python is awesome and you are missing out!

## How do you use the codes?
<ol>
  <li> Download the zip or clone the git (green button on the upper right).</li>
  <li> Install python (see below). </li>
  <li> Launch jupyter-lab . </li>
  <li> Modify the code for your needs.</li>
  <li> Enjoy the time you just saved to solve the world's problem.</li>
  </ol>
  
## Python
I recommend <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/"> anaconda</a>. It works on all platforms. Follow the instructions and it should work! Launch anaconda navigator and click on jupyter lab or jupyter notebook. Or launch a terminal (mac OS) or anaconda terminal (Windows) and execute jupyter-lab or jupyter-notebook. Then navigate to the folder of your choice and click on the file with .ipynb extension.

I highly recommend codecademy or datacamp python tutorial. I would recommend a CS python course but an online tutorial is anywhere between 30 mins to 5 h. 

If you ask nicely, I will help. The Chair job is painful enough, we might as well help each other!

On that note, a big thank you to the UVM ME faculty and staff for their support and to the Chairs, Dean and Staff of the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences for their help in navigating this chair job thingy.
